# DockerQA: Docker-based Generic Enablers Quality Assurance Generic Enablers of FIWARE
This document describes the DockerQA service developed at ITESM as a tool for verifying the correct deployment of the Dockers of the Generic Enablers of the FIWARE catalogue.

[FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) is a curated framework of open source platform components to accelerate the development of Smart solutions. The [FIWARE platform](https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/) provides a rather simple yet powerful set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that ease the development of Smart Applications in multiple vertical sectors. 

The main and only mandatory component of any "Powered by FIWARE" platform or solution is the [FIWARE Orion Context Broker Generic Enabler](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/), which brings a cornerstone function in any smart solution: the need to manage context information in a highly decentralized and large-scale manner, enabling to perform updates and bring access to context.
